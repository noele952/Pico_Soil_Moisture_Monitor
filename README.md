# Pico Soil Moisture Monitor

This project is a plant monitoring system that measures soil moisture levels using sensors and displays the information on an OLED screen. The system is designed to work with Blynk for remote monitoring.

## Software Dependencies

Install the following Micropythonlibraries on the pico w microcontroller

- [SSD1306 Driver GitHub](https://github.com/noele952/micropython-ssd1306-custom-text/blob/main/ssd1306.py)

- [umqtt.simple GitHub](https://github.com/fizista/micropython-umqtt.simple2)

## Deployment

A CloudFormation File is included which will deploy the AWS IoT resources for the Soil Moisture Monitor, including a Lambda function that will send a watering reminder when the moisture level is low. A valid SES email is required for sending.

In order to create a secure connection you will need to manually generate and download a security certificate and private key in AWS IoT Core. You will also need to connect that certificate the the Iot Thing Policy generated by the CloudFormation file

The downloaded security certificate and private key then need to be converted to DER format, and saved in the /certs folder on the Pico.

To complete the conversion you will need to have openssl installed

```
openssl rsa -in private.pem.key -out private.der - outform DER

openssl x509 -in certificate.pem.crt -out certificate.der -outform DER
```

## Usage

To use this plant monitoring system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to the pico microcontroller.
2. Set up the hardware as per the instructions in the [Hardware Setup](#hardware-setup) section.
3. Ensure that the required libraries are available on your Microcontroller's filesystem. You can place them in a `lib` directory in your project folder.
4. Configure the necessary parameters in the code, such as Wi-Fi credentials and Blynk authentication token.
5. Run the main script on your microcontroller.

The soil moisture monitor can be powered by the USB port on the pico board, or plug in a 3V(AA x 2) battery. 2 moisture sensors are attached. If a sensor reads low moisture, the LED below the sensor lights up. Pressing the button will display the current moisture percentage for sensor 1, press again to see the value for sensor 2, and a third press clears the screen.
